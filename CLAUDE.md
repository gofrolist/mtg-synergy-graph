## Project Overview

MTG Synergy Graph — deterministic, rule-based EDH/Commander synergy scorer
using Forge DSL ports. No training, no EDHREC at inference.
Current aggregate NDCG@30 ~ 0.194, Hi-Syn 160/1000 on the 100-commander golden set.
Port extraction: 184,106 ports from 32,327 cards (GenericChoice + StaticAbilities$ expansion).

## Common Commands

```bash
uv run python scripts/import_cardsfolder.py                              # Import fresh DB
uv run python scripts/recommend.py --commander "Korvold, Fae-Cursed King" --top 30 --explain
uv run python scripts/compare_edhrec.py --commanders tests/fixtures/golden_set.json
uv run python scripts/golden_set_track.py --baseline tests/fixtures/golden_set_run.json
uv run pytest tests/                                                     # 212 tests, ~1s

## Scoring Architecture — Universal Port Matcher

Score = count of distinct mechanical interactions between commander ports
and candidate ports, weighted by specificity (IDF). **No hand-tuned weights.
No global penalties.** The commander's ports ARE the query.

### Complement Rules (`complement_rules.py`)

~10 `ComplementRule` objects define when a (commander_port, candidate_port)
pair creates a synergy. Each wraps an existing mechanical map.

### IDF Weighting (`universal_scorer.py`)

Each complement's value = `1 / log2(1 + N)` where N = number of candidates
sharing the same match tuple. Specific matches (Saproling lord: N=3, IDF≈0.50)
worth more than broad matches (sacrifice cost: N=2000, IDF≈0.09).

Density rules use flat weights to prevent IDF from penalizing broad-but-correct
matching: spell_density 0.3, scaling 0.3, tribal_density 0.5, etb_self 0.01,
token_producer 0.25, evasion 0.15, pan_density 0.10.

Multi-rule bonus: cards matching 3+ distinct rule_ids get +0.1 per extra rule
(rewards multi-axis synergy picks like Pitiless Plunderer).

### Algorithm

1. Load commander ports (cached)
2. For each complement rule, find matching candidate ports (2 SQL queries)
3. For card-attribute rules, match against cards table
4. Compute IDF weights from candidate frequency
5. Score each candidate = sum of IDF-weighted synergy - anti-synergy + staple bonus
6. Sort by (-score, cmc, edhrec_rank, name)

### Key Files

- `complement_rules.py` — rules registry, `find_all_complements()`
- `universal_scorer.py` — IDF computation, `score_all_universal()`
- `engine.py` — `SynergyEngine.page()`, public API
- `graph_engine.py` — `EVENT_MATCH_MAP`, `COST_FEEDS_TRIGGER`, port matching primitives

## Conventions

- Cards keyed by Scryfall `oracle_id`.
- SQL fragment interpolation guarded by `_VALID_*_EXPRS` frozensets +
  `ValueError` (never `assert` — stripped by `python -O`).
