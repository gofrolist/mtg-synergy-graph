## Project Overview

MTG Synergy Graph — deterministic, rule-based EDH/Commander synergy scorer
using Forge DSL ports. No training, no EDHREC at inference.
Current aggregate NDCG@30 ~ 0.131 on the 100-commander golden set.

## Common Commands

```bash
uv run python scripts/import_cardsfolder.py                              # Import fresh DB
uv run python scripts/recommend.py --commander "Korvold, Fae-Cursed King" --top 30 --explain
uv run python scripts/compare_edhrec.py --commanders tests/fixtures/golden_set.json
uv run python scripts/golden_set_track.py --baseline tests/fixtures/golden_set_run.json
uv run pytest tests/                                                     # 212 tests, ~1s
```

## Scoring Architecture — Universal Port Matcher

Score = count of distinct mechanical interactions between commander ports
and candidate ports, weighted by specificity (IDF). **No hand-tuned weights.
No global penalties.** The commander's ports ARE the query.

### Complement Rules (`complement_rules.py`)

~10 `ComplementRule` objects define when a (commander_port, candidate_port)
pair creates a synergy. Each wraps an existing mechanical map.

| Rule | Commander Port | Candidate Port | Source |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| trigger_effect | trigger | effect | EVENT_MATCH_MAP |
| cost_feeds_trigger | trigger | cost | COST_FEEDS_TRIGGER |
| trigger_resonance | trigger | trigger | shared event axis |
| effect_resonance | effect | effect | resonant effects |
| replacement_resonance | effect | replacement | doubler matching |
| replacement_producer | replacement | effect | producer matching |
| replacement_blocks | trigger | replacement | anti-synergy |
| sacrifice_cluster | trigger | trigger | death-axis clustering |
| lord | card subtypes | static | tribal lord matching |
| etb_self | trigger filter | card identity | ETB/dies self-matching |
| scaling | scales_with | card type | Aura/Equipment density |
| spell_density | SpellCast filter | card type | spell-type density |
| tribal_density | token subtypes | card subtype | tribal creature density |
| zone_resonance | ChangesZone filter | ChangesZone trigger | landfall resonance |

### IDF Weighting (`universal_scorer.py`)

Each complement's value = `1 / log2(1 + N)` where N = number of candidates
sharing the same match tuple. Specific matches (Saproling lord: N=3, IDF≈0.50)
worth more than broad matches (sacrifice cost: N=2000, IDF≈0.09).

Density rules (spell_density, scaling, tribal_density, etb_self) use flat
weight 1.0 — for these, matching many candidates IS the strategy.

### Algorithm

1. Load commander ports (cached)
2. For each complement rule, find matching candidate ports (2 SQL queries)
3. For card-attribute rules, match against cards table
4. Compute IDF weights from candidate frequency
5. Score each candidate = sum of IDF-weighted synergy - anti-synergy + staple bonus
6. Sort by (-score, cmc, edhrec_rank, name)

### Key Files

- `complement_rules.py` — rules registry, `find_all_complements()`
- `universal_scorer.py` — IDF computation, `score_all_universal()`
- `engine.py` — `SynergyEngine.page()`, public API
- `graph_engine.py` — `EVENT_MATCH_MAP`, `COST_FEEDS_TRIGGER`, port matching primitives

## Conventions

- Cards keyed by Scryfall `oracle_id`.
- SQL fragment interpolation guarded by `_VALID_*_EXPRS` frozensets +
  `ValueError` (never `assert` — stripped by `python -O`).
